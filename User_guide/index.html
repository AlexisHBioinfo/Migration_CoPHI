  <p>
    CoPHI is an interactive visualization system of parallel coordinates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finding reaction patterns through metabolic pathways allows the identification of constraints and interactions between enzymatic reactions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Computing Elementary Flux modes is a way to know feasible pathways through a metabolic network. The set size of these feasible pathways requires tools to display results. CoPHI is a user-friendly web application to display sets of Elementary Flux modes using a parallel coordinates graph.

  <h2>How to import data</h2>
  <p>
    To import data you have to click the "Select a file" button from the left panel.
    <div><img class="screenshot" title="Select a file" id="Parcourir" src="./images_guide/Parcourir.png"></div>
    You can now choose the file to import from the new opened window. The file you select must be a table where values are split by comas, tabulations, spaces or semicolons.

    You may click again the first button of the top panel to go back to the previous setting where scrolling does not zoom at all.

  <h2>How to displace axes</h2>
  <p>
    To displace axes, you have to click the fifth button of the top panel which allows axes to be dragged anywhere you want.
    <div><img class="screenshot click_interact" title="Drag button showed by the red arrow" id="click_displace" src="./images_guide/displace.png"></div>
    <div class="example_div"><img class="screenshot displace" title="Tpep on the 2nd place" id="displace_1" src="./images_guide/displace_1.png"><img class="screenshot displace" title="Tpep on the 3rd place" id="displace_2" src="./images_guide/displace_2.png"></div>
    You may click again the fifth button of the top panel to go back to the previous setting where clicks do not interact with the graph.

  <h2>How to change the color scheme</h2>
